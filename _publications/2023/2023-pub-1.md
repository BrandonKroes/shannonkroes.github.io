  Cluster-based synthetic data generation (CBSDG) offers an explainable, privacy-preserving way to share sensitive data. We applied CBSDG to 250,729 real blood-transfusion records and trained SVMs to predict donor hemoglobin levels, matching original precision (male 0.997, female 0.987) and showing comparable recall and feature‐impact patterns. Most attributes became harder to infer, with only deferral status and sex remaining detectable—demonstrating CBSDG’s promise for practical use.

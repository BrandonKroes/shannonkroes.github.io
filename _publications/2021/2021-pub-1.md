  Although data protection is compulsory when personal data is shared, there is no systematic method available to evaluate to what extent each individual is at risk of a privacy breach. We use a collection of measures that quantify how much information is needed to uncover sensitive information. Combined with visualization techniques, our approach can be used to perform a detailed privacy analysis of medical data. Because privacy is evaluated per variable, these adjustments can be made while incorporating how likely it is that these variables will be exploited to uncover sensitive information in practice, as is mandatory in the European Union. Additionally, the analysis of privacy can be used to evaluate to what extent knowledge on specific variables in the data can contribute to privacy breaches, which can subsequently guide the use of anonymization techniques, such as generalization.

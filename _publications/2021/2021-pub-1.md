    A novel, variable-centric paradigm merges rigorous information-theoretic metrics with dynamic visualizations to elevate the understanding of individual privacy risk within medical datasets. By contextualizing each featureâ€™s real-world exploitability, the methodology fulfills regulatory mandates and informs the creation of nuanced anonymization schemes, thereby illuminating the delicate balance between data utility and confidentiality.
